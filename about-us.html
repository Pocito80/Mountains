                  <br>
                  We founded our company "POLAND MOUNTAIN" in 2016 with the goal of sharing our passion for astronomy and mountain climbing with the world. We have always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and the thrill of conquering high peaks, and we knew that we wanted to create a platform through which we could share our knowledge, experiences, and enthusiasm with others.

                  Since starting our company, we have been committed to promoting the beauty and wonder of astronomy and mountain climbing, as well as the importance of environmental conservation and sustainable practices. We have worked tirelessly to organize educational events, expeditions, and community service projects, and we are proud of the impact that we have had so far.
                  
                  We believe that our passion for astronomy and mountain climbing is contagious and we hope to inspire others to pursue their own passions and make a positive impact on the world. We are grateful for the opportunity to share our love of these subjects with the world and we are excited to see what the future holds for our company. So, we are proud to be the founders of "POLAND MOUNTAIN."
